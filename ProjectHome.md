PyroPlot is a Matlab tool to handle and examine data from small scale experiments on material behaviour. It enables user to plot multiple time series without having to open and import each file one by one. In addition, it has tools for the data analysis and parameter estimation using genetic algorithm.

It is not proved yet that the parameters found by the algorithm developed here are really modelling large scale fires correctly. However, the smaller tests and simulations seem to work fine and that is promising. The next step is to validate parameters by making larger scale tests and simulations.

This project is in the early stages of active development. It should be considered an alpha release, and caution should be taken both use and application of its output.

The matlab toolbox needed for using genetic algorithm is available in http://www.shef.ac.uk/acse/research/ecrg/getgat.html, developed by the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering of The University of Sheffield, UK.
